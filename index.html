                        <p>In my academic journey, I <strong>explored</strong> various scientific fields. I
                            <strong>graduated</strong> from high school in 2023 holding technical certifications in
                            Pre-hospital Care, Firefighting, and Nursing. Later, I <strong>expanded</strong> my
                            knowledge by completing courses in diverse areas, including programming. I
                            <strong>chose</strong> to focus on this path, which led me to my current studies in Software
                            Construction and Development Technology at Antonio Nariño University in Bogotá.</p>

                            several years. Additionally, I <strong>have been</strong> a first aid and self-defense
                            instructor for youth, and I <strong>have managed</strong> a local branch for the Fundación

                        <p>My name is Manuel Martinez, I am 20 years old, and this is my story. I was born in 2005 in
                            the town of Calarcá, Quindío. At the age of 4, I moved to Bogotá, where I grew up and
                            attended several schools throughout my academic journey. As I shared earlier, my path hasn't
                            been a straight line; it has been a journey of exploration—from emergency services to the
                            world of technology—driven by a desire to learn and help others.</p>
